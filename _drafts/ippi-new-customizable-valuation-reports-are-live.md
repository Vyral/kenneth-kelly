iPPi is an all-in-one property price, market data, and valuations platform. We centralize all available property data to create the cleanest, most current and most comprehensive property transaction database to property professionals all across Ireland. Today I’m going to create an appraisal, demonstrate some new features we’ve added over the last few weeks, and share what’s to come.

Follow along at **0:39** as I create a new report and use the feature which allows you title reports whichever you please (here I use, “Valuation Report Mr. Smith). This is Step 1: Property Particulars.

The example property I’m using for my report is a four-bedroom house (fill out all areas marked with a star if you can; the more information you have, the better). Then you’ll be able to grab a Google Street View, take its print, and add it to the search (optional).

In Step 2: Comparables **(1:35)**, you’ll note that on the map we’ve color-coded properties based on ‘sold’ and ‘for sale;’ you can filter out sold homes easily, and vice versa. Once you select three properties on the map, you’ll see three boxes across the top of the screen: mean price per sq. meters, suggested price based on square meters, and the mean price comparables (i.e., the mean price of the properties you’ve selected). With each selected comparable, you’re able to go into a lot more detail and check out their condition.

Now on to Step 3: Adjustments **(2:22)**. In this stage, I set a price range of €1.2 to €1.3 million. At this step, you can also choose to set a price, make no adjustments at all, or explore more detailed adjustments.

In Step 4: Widgets **(2:42)**, you can decide what you want to show on the report, and tailor it to the conversation you’ll be having. There are five total boxes to choose from: advertised prices, rental prices, cost per sqM, sales volume, and average sale sold price. You can then choose to include maps.

After you choose widgets, you’ll be able to generate the report **(3:12)**. You can download it and/or send it as an email attachment. You’re able to customize the cover photo to include things like your headshot and company logo.

Follow along at **4:10** to check out the final product, starting with the Executive Summary (location, number of beds, size, final valuation range and comparable properties). In addition to displaying data based on the widgets you selected earlier, there is also a discussion section, allowing you to interpret the data presented and offer some professional points of your own. The report also includes a Nearby Amenities section, wherein proximity to things like cr&eacute;ches, primary and secondary schools, parks, and restaurants is listed. Near the bottom of the report, you’ll see the new graph functionale, whereby it’s a lot easier to see the sold history and how it's performing.

I hope you’ve found this demonstration helpful. If you have any questions about our latest updates or how to apply, please feel free to reach out at any time.
