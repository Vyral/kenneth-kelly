    pullquote: Fantastic service!

  - quote: "We heard about iPPi through IPAV. Having tailed it for 1 month, we now use it every day. As we are on the bank valuations panel for EBS, Haven, AIB and Ulster Bank, we find it a great tool for valuations. We have also used it for sales valuations with phenomenal results, as the iPPi tool, produces a magnificent valuation appraisal with comparables, maps, photos of the property and most of all our company logo. Having trialed all of the other valuation tools, we have decided to choose iPPi for its simplicity, accurate information and professional valuation appraisals"
