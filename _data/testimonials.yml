  - quote: "We have been using iPPi for a number of months now and find it to be an invaluable tool for finding comparables for valuations. We provide an auction service nationwide for over 200 agents at present, so as you can imagine, we have a variety of properties available for sale. This website helps us to be more efficient with our time in gathering comparables as the comparable properties information, is readily available on the iPPi website. It cuts the time in half! I would highly recommend this to anyone in the industry and the support from Ciaran and the team is excellent!"

  - quote: "We heard about iPPi through IPAV. Having tailed it for 1 month, we now use it every day. As we are on the bank valuations panel for EBS, Haven, AIB and Ulster Bank, we find it a great tool for valuations. We have also used it for sales valuations with phenomenal results, as the iPPi tool, produces a magnificent valuation appraisal with comparables, maps, photos of the property and most of all our company logo. Having trialed all of the other valuation tools, we have decided to choose iPPi for its simplicity, accurate information and professional valuation appraisals"
